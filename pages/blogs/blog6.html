                       <h3>1. Accurate Inventory Management</h3>

                        Due to its capacity for handling large amounts of data, AI-driven technologies can be extremely useful in inventory management. Accurate inventory management can help ensure that products enter and exit a warehouse in the proper sequence.
                     
                        <h3>2. SMART roads</h3>
                     
                         Another application of artificial intelligence in the logistics industry is smart roads. Several companies are working on building them. Smart roads help improve road safety and reduce delays in the supply chain caused by unfavorable weather conditions, making deliveries faster.
                     
                     <h3>3. Predictive maintenance</h3>
                     
                         Predictive maintenance is predicting potential machine failures in the factory by analyzing real-time data collected from IoT sensors in machines. Machine learning-powered analytics tools enhance predictive analytics and identify patterns in sensor data so that technicians can take action before the failure occurs.
