                        A survey was conducted in which it was found that more than 53% of the respondent were not satisfied with their profession. and the reasons were low income, harassment from police, RTO inefficiency, corruption, local group misbehavior, unscheduled working hours, and last but not least less time with family and more time with roads. Not only that it was also founded that 9 out of 10 drivers haven’t received any formal training.

Even the government has setupped up to slow down the deaths of the driver by setting up highway patrolling unit but it hasn’t worked out what was expected. The truck driver job is not only a tough job for drivers but also for their family too. family too suffer because as drivers are away from home for 15 - 20 days their family members are in constant worry whether their loved ones are fine or not whether they have eaten the food or not and many more.

We are now able to do things that were once impossible. For example, we are able to track shipments in real-time, manage inventory and orders more efficiently, and even predict demand. This is just the beginning of what the future holds.
